Create connections between posts

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to create many-to-many relationships between posts of all types.

You can use it to manually create lists of related posts.

Or, if you have a 'product' post type, you can make a by-directional connection to a 'review' post type.

The possibilities are endless.

Head out to the [Wiki](https://github.com/scribu/wp-posts-to-posts/wiki) for tutorials and other resources.
